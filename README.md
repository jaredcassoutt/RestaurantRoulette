# RestaurantRoulette
This is a Swift app that utilizes the MapKit library to provide a restaurant recommendation based on food located near me. Once location permissions are provided by the user, the map isolates on the users location with a specified radius and map annotations are displayed for each restaurant within that radius. Once the user selects the random button, a restaurant is chosen and information such as the name, phone number, and directions are provided to the user in a UIAlertController.
